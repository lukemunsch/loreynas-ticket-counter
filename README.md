## Overview

The app for Loreyna's Ticket Counter is an online ticket sales site that allows adventurers to book their travel destinations to anywhere on Eorzea. The tickets are a digital product and therefore have no delivery requirements, the products are redeemable from the aetheryte plaza to anywhere that also houses an aetheryte crystal.
The site offers a simple as well as helpful solution to navigate the wide world of Eorzea; locating where you would like to travel to and searching from a list of locations, with the feature to filter based on the main locations in the world and even the more specific districts within the locations. Each specific destination has a recogniseable image, a supporting description, there is even a badge that can be added to specific hotspots for people to see where is most popular.
The list of destinations will continue to increase while destinations are discovered and new Aetheryte crystals are installed, which means that the site owners will be able to update and keep materials fresh for the adventurers that want to travel to these destinations as and when they want.

## Deployment

To deploy Loreyna's Ticket Counter, allow other people to run the app and see it working, there are 3 methods to allow you to complete these actions:

### Forking and Cloning

Accessing GitHub and navigating to my repositories will allow users to copy my code directly from the source, either by forking or cloning: Accessing the Loreyna's Ticket Counter repository and clicking on the code button next to Gitpod link will bring up a menu to create a repository of your own in your own GitHub repo. There is also the Download zip file option which will allow you to save a copy of my code as well.

### Local Deployment

For local deployment of Loreyna's Ticket Counter, I will be using Gitpod to edit and run my workspace;
- From GitHub, once the repository has been created (either as a new project or by forking/cloning) I will then click on the Gitpod button to implement the creation of a workspace to edit the promotional sales review system.

***The workspace should not be closed due to the env.py file; as it is never added to GitHub, if you create a new workspace you will need to re-add the env.py file and reinstall all libraries used each time. Pinning a workspace and accessing it from Gitpod workspaces will save time and repetition***
