## Overview

The app for Loreyna's Ticket Counter is an online ticket sales site that allows adventurers to book their travel destinations to anywhere on Eorzea. The tickets are a digital product and therefore have no delivery requirements, the products are redeemable from the aetheryte plaza to anywhere that also houses an aetheryte crystal.
The site offers a simple as well as helpful solution to navigate the wide world of Eorzea; locating where you would like to travel to and searching from a list of locations, with the feature to filter based on the main locations in the world and even the more specific districts within the locations. Each specific destination has a recogniseable image, a supporting description, there is even a badge that can be added to specific hotspots for people to see where is most popular.
The list of destinations will continue to increase while destinations are discovered and new Aetheryte crystals are installed, which means that the site owners will be able to update and keep materials fresh for the adventurers that want to travel to these destinations as and when they want.
